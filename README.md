Facts: 
- **Extremely cute** fluffy mammals (see picture above)
- Their face colours resemble a **masked bandit**, which fits their chacter perfectly as they love to steal fruits and vegetables from gardens.
- They can often be found looking for dinner in the trash cans which got them the name '**_Trash pandas_**'
- They like to wash their food, which sometimes leaves them (_and the viewer_) heartbroken ([Watch the heartbreaking racoon video at your own risk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfbb4yRBH64/))

### On top of being **undeniably cute**, we also love to make them into more or less relatable memes.

Just a few examples:

### And last but not least - a short original **haiku about racoons**.  
>_Bananas are sweet,_  
>_the peels you should throw away._  
>_Racoons will eat them._

## I hope you enjoyed the racoon content!

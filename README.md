Facts: 
- Extremely cute looking fluffy mammals (see picture above)
- Their face colours resemble a masked bandit, which fits their chacter perfectly as they love to steal fruits and vegetables from gardens.
- They can often be found looking for dinner in the trash cans which got them the name 'Trash pandas'
- They like to wash their food, which sometimes leaves them (and the viewer) heartbroken (The proof can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfbb4yRBH64)
